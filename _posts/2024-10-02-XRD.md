Do you find logging elemental percentage data from a generated report to be time-consuming? Here's a quick solution, as long as you're familiar with basic Python and ChatGPT prompts:
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/posts/XRD.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

1. **Save all the images from the XRD report** using this script: [`save_imgs_in_MSword.ipynb`](https://github.com/ZJ-Gao/OCR_XRD_Reports/blob/main/save_imgs_in_MSword.ipynb). Or you can copy from the code snippet at the bottom of this blog. The images will be automatically numbered and saved in the same directory as the report.
2. **Remove unnecessary images**: If the report contains images that are not XRD graphs, you can manually delete them.
3. **Use the ChatGPT-4 model**: This model has a robust embedded vision system that works well for OCR tasks. I tested several Python OCR libraries, even with data enhancement techniques, but none achieved satisfactory results. If you're aware of any high-performance open-source OCR models, please share them!
4. **Use the following prompt in ChatGPT**:
    
    *For all the images I upload, extract the information from the legend and create a table. The first column should be "Spectrum," and the subsequent columns should represent elemental information (O, Si, K, Al, Na) and their respective weight percentages (Wt%). Exclude the standard deviation (Ïƒ).*
    
5. **Download the extracted data**: ChatGPT will provide a table with the extracted data, which you can download as a CSV file.
6. **Verify the results**: Randomly select a few graphs to check the accuracy of the data extraction by ChatGPT-4.

### Notes:

- In ChatGPT, you can upload up to 10 images at a time and are subject to a daily upload limit. This process works well for small tasks.
- However, for larger datasets (like mine), I'm looking for a solution that can handle batch processing locally. If you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to reach out!

### Grab the codes

```python
from docx import Document
from PIL import Image
import io

# Load the Word document
doc_path = 'Camp Century Hawke_USU-4183B 250-355 Points.docx'  # Update with your document path
doc = Document(doc_path)

# Iterate through the document and save images
for i, rel in enumerate(doc.part.rels.values()):
    if "image" in rel.target_ref:
        image = rel.target_part.blob
        image_stream = io.BytesIO(image)
        img = Image.open(image_stream)
        img.save(f'image_{i + 1}.png')  # Save images as PNG files

# Note: Update the file extension as needed based on the image type
```
