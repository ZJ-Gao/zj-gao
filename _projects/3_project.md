This is a placeholder for summarizing the research from my master's work, making it more accessible, and sharing the story of how I set up a machine and safety closet from scratch. It's been quite a journey of self-growth for someone who didn't even know how to use a wrench before this project—though I’m not sure that’s something to be too proud of!
